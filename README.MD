### Mars Rover

This is a fun application about deploying rovers to the Mars and giving commands to them.

##### Run

Open `index.html` under the `dist` folder and use program from console by the help of `sampleCommand.txt`.

##### Limitations

Some ES6 features used on this application without any using transpiler. Thus I've expect to work this application ES6 supported browsers(namely Chrome and Firefox).
